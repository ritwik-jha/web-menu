# web based menu for automating different technologies (task-9.2)

In this task we have created a web based menu using which we can operate the linux backend without knowing the actual commands.
This helps us to work on different technologies without knowing the actual commands for those. Being a web based user interface it can be easily used by anyone and is very easy to understand.

For this we create a html frontend that will be the user interface. The frontend consists of forms using which we can submit our options and the output will be shown in a new tab.
The html form collects the data and user selected options and sends it to the backend python program running in the server using http GET method. 

The backend program made using python language recieves the data and process it and returns the desired output.
